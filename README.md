# Terminal-Game-Area-Calculator-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Codedex Python course project - built a basic terminal story game which includes an area calculator for circle, triangle and square, and a paper scissors rock game. Note, not using functions or anything complicated, only while loops and if else statements as this is what has been learned so far.
